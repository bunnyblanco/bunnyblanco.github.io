  <h1>Notes on My Code</h1>
  <h3>October 2, 2016</h3>
  <p>

    Currently, the projects I have in my repositories are
    "archives."&nbsp; I can't say they are being worked on
    actively.&nbsp; I hope to change this situation with some work on
    opensource projects already in my repositories along with some new
    ones.
